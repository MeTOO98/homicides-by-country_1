# 🌍 Homicides by Country – Data Analysis Project

This project explores global homicide statistics using data visualization and analysis techniques in Python. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and country-wise insights into homicide rates across the world.

## 📊 Project Overview

The notebook provides an analytical perspective on the distribution of homicides per 100,000 people by country. Through various graph-based visualizations, the project highlights disparities in homicide rates and brings attention to regional differences and possible influencing factors.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `Homicides by Country Project1.ipynb` – The main Jupyter notebook containing the code, visualizations, and insights.
- `README.md` – This file, providing an overview of the project.

## 📌 Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  Proper formatting and handling of missing data to ensure accuracy in visual analysis.

- **Data Visualization**  
  Several types of plots and graphs are used to communicate insights effectively:
  
  - Bar plots of homicides per country
  - line plots of homicides per year
    
- **Insights & Interpretation**  
  Visual interpretations that allow readers to quickly grasp which countries or regions are most affected.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas

## 🔍 Notable Findings

- Some countries have significantly higher homicide rates per 100,000 people.
- Regional trends (e.g., Latin America vs. Europe) suggest socioeconomic or political influences.
- Visualizations make it easy to compare across multiple dimensions.
